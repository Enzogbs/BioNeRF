title: BioNeRF - Biologically Plausible Neural Radiance Fields
email: leandropassosjr@gmail.com
description: BioNeRF (Biologically Plausible Neural Radiance Fields) extends NeRF by implementing a cognitive-inspired mechanism that fuses inputs from multiple sources into a memory-like structure, thus improving the storing capacity and extracting more intrinsic and correlated information. BioNeRF also mimics a behavior observed in pyramidal cells concerning contextual information, in which the memory is provided as the context and combined with the inputs of two subsequent blocks of dense layers, one responsible for producing the volumetric densities and the other the colors used to render the novel view.
